% problem 17: solve the kepler equation

% constants
n = 300; % steps to be taken
ecc = [0.1, 0.9]; % eccentricity
M = linspace(0, 2*pi, n); % mean anomoly
E_num = zeros(n, 1); % accumulators for results
E_theo = zeros(n, 1);
j = 1:400; % values of indices in theoretical sol'n

% calculate numerical and theoretical solutions
for e in ecc
    for i = 1:n
        % calculate numerical solution by newton's method
        E = 0.1; % initial guess
        for ii = 1:50
            f = E - e*sin(E) - M; % value of function
            df = 1 - e*cos(E); % derivative value
            E = E - (f / df); % compute next guess
        end
        E_num(i) = E; % put numerical value in accumulator
